Lena,Malia,Connor Swenson,RFK,T,"Independent Presidential Candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., August 12th, 2024","As he continues his independent Presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sat down with CBS6 on Power and Politics for a wide-ranging, 30-minute interview.
Their conversation begins with RFK Jr.'s thoughts on the recent federal trial in Albany regarding a lawsuit by Democrats to get RFK Jr. off the ballot in New York State.
From there RFK addressed leaving the Democratic Party, and his family's reaction to that, as some have since endorsed the Biden-Harris campaign. He says he stands for a Democratic Party which believes in freedom of speech, pro-life and bodily autonomy, anti-war and that represents the American middle class.
RFK's ""America Strong"" platform is his plan to ""unify America"", with many of its tenets focused on ending ""politically motivated"" prosecutions of private and political figures, so CBS6 asked if he would pardon Donald Trump if elected. RFK Jr. said he'd need to investigate further, and also, when asked if he'd be in Mr. Trump's cabinet, resolutely said ""No.""
His views differ on American support in Ukraine and Israel, which he discussed at length, saying the United States is fighting a proxy war of their own in Ukraine, and that Israel has a right to defend themselves after the attacks from Hamas.
He says he wants to address and reverse negative U.S. health outcomes, and address the impact of artificial intelligence moving forward.
CBS6 also asked him why the ""skeletons"" in his closet are different than any other politician. He responded by saying he is telling the truth, and never planned on running for President of the United State, and that he ""wouldn't run for Pope.""

Joining us today is Vivek Ramaswamy, entrepreneur, author, and former presidential candidate. He's been making a hard pitch for what he's called a ""libertarian-nationalist alliance"" for the past several months. He was at the 2024 Libertarian National Convention where he tried to convince libertarians to vote Republican. Reason's Zach Weissmueller also saw Ramaswamy at the Republican National Convention, where he was trying to convince MAGA supporters to be more libertarian. Reason's Stephanie Slade saw him make his case for ""national libertarianism"" at the National Conservatism Conference. That event was also attended by vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, who has a different vision for the conservative movement. Those dueling visions are the subject of today's episode.

Thomas Seeger,Malia,Thomas Leonard,Vivek Ramaswamy,T,Reining in the Administrative State: A Conversation with Vivek Ramaswamy,"There’s a quietly brewing rift on the right between those who want to rein in administrative power and those who hope to wield it for conservative ends. Former presidential candidate and business entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy favors the former path and has delivered detailed plans for a radical rollback of regulatory power and shutting down several federal agencies. With the Supreme Court’s recent blows to Chevron deference and its embrace of the major questions doctrine, he sees a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to rein in the permanent bureaucracy. Ramaswamy argues that it is not controversial to hold that the people we elect to run the government should actually run the government.Is the United States consigned to rule by an army of unelected and unaccountable federal bureaucrats? Are there any realistic paths to diminish the power of federal government bureaucracies?Join Ramaswamy and Cato’s Gene Healy for a discussion about the prospects for transforming how the federal government rules its citizens and businesses.

Kennedy Jr. is a writer, attorney, activist, and politician who has had a career-spanning focus on clean water, environmental, and public health issues. RFK Jr. is the founder of the WaterKeeper Alliance — the world’s largest clean water advocacy group — and has served as its longtime chairman and attorney. In this role, he spearheaded the New York City Watershed Agreement, which has come to be considered an international model for sustainable development and stakeholder consensus negotiation. RFK Jr. was named Time Magazine’s “Hero for the Planet” for his efforts to restore the Hudson River, which along with other achievements has led to more than 300 WaterKeeper organizations taking root across the globe. As nephew of the United States' beloved 35th president, he has dutifully earned his own acclaim across decades of formative work.  - Links - For Robert F.

Thomas Seeger,Rosie,Connor Swenson,Vivek Ramaswamy,T,Vivek Ramaswamy Has a Different Vision for Trumpism From JD Vance,"Vivek Ramaswamy burst onto the national scene last year as a wild card candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Here was a relatively unknown biotech executive with no political experience, pitching himself as someone who could carry on Donald Trump’s movement. Trump ultimately won that primary contest handily, but Ramaswamy was a breakout star. There was even chatter that he might be Trump’s V.P. pick.Trump, of course, ended up choosing JD Vance — Ramaswamy’s friend and former classmate — who has a very different vision for the future of Trumpism. But Ramaswamy believes the future of the Trump movement is still up for grabs and is fighting hard for his camp to win out over the one that Vance represents, including in his new book, “Truths: The Future of America First.”In this conversation, we discuss the two competing visions that Ramaswamy sees as lurking beneath the surface of Trumpism, what he calls “national protectionist” and “national libertarian,” whether his vision is really so different from Paul Ryan-style conservativism, why he thinks these debates within the Republican Party are really deep down about identity and what it means to be an American.Book Recommendations:The Constitution of Liberty by Friedrich HayekThe Bhagavad GitaThe Road to Serfdom by Friedrich HayekThoughts?

Lena,rosie,Amber*,Vivek Ramaswamy,T,The Ezra Klein Show: Vivek Ramaswamy Has a Different Vision for Trumpism From JD Vance,"Vivek Ramaswamy burst onto the national scene last year as a wild card candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Here was a relatively unknown biotech executive with no political experience, pitching himself as someone who could carry on Donald Trump’s movement. Trump ultimately won that primary contest handily, but Ramaswamy was a breakout star. There was even chatter that he might be Trump’s V.P. pick.Trump, of course, ended up choosing JD Vance — Ramaswamy’s friend and former classmate — who has a very different vision for the future of Trumpism. But Ramaswamy believes the future of the Trump movement is still up for grabs and is fighting hard for his camp to win out over the one that Vance represents, including in his new book, “Truths: The Future of America First.”In this conversation, we discuss the two competing visions that Ramaswamy sees as lurking beneath the surface of Trumpism, what he calls “national protectionist” and “national libertarian,” whether his vision is really so different from Paul Ryan-style conservativism, why he thinks these debates within the Republican Party are really deep down about identity and what it means to be an American.","interfluidity, subscribed podcasts",,Vivek Ramaswamy Has a Different Vision for Trumpism From JD Vance - YouTube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY6NGom3gvU,81,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Buy the book here. In ""Truths: The Future of America First,"" Ramaswamy shows exactly how honesty about the most important issues will get our country back on track. The America First movement emphasizes the issues that bring us together, not what divides us. It asks that we put our country over politics, merit over grievance, and truth over lies.

We believe in our 1st amendment and free speech.
Nothing is more important than our God given right to express our opinions, ideas, questions and concerns.
We believe in our God given right to a media who is allowed to openly speak truth to power, question everything with boldness, and even mock the mockable like the court jesters of yesteryear.
The necessary exchange of ideas, suggestions, opinions, and revisions of opinions is paramount to sifting through news stories. The ""act of committing journalism"" is the exploration of uncharted intellectual territory, where sometimes we can only be guided by instinct and intuition. That is known as having a ""nose for the news"".
TNAM has a pretty stellar track record (nose for news) since 2011 and we'll put our batting average up against any other media outlet in this world, or in any worlds yet to be discovered.
We analyze rumors that can't be confirmed, we sift through ""official propaganda"", & we call out the lies. We NEVER want you to take our opinion as fact. Likewise, you must never take the bold claims of an official ""fact checker"" as accurate & you must not put your blind faith in anyone.
You must reject the fiction that two plus two equals five.
We humbly request that you do your OWN research. In the endless pursuit of truth, the social media companies prefer that we add links to ""countervailing views"" on the two most hot button issues of our day, so please feel free to peruse these sites for your consideration:
CISA.gov/RumorControl (regarding the 2020 election)
and CDC.gov/vaccines (regarding medical claims, and the ensuing political decisions related to the topic)
Feel free to peruse these sites and watch how they claim to know as fact that the 2020 election was the most ""safe and secure election in the history of Earth"".
Some other sites claim that they, (and only they), are allowed to have opinions on important matters like: ""the things you must insert into your body"" and ""all things related to medicine"".
We at TNAM ask you,...yes, YOU, to consider all of the points both FOR and AGAINST whatever ""the narrative"" of the day is.
The New American Media encourages you to seek truth, challenge dogma, & have fun.
Thank you,

He was a staunch defender of President Biden remaining in the race, arguing that Mr. Biden was best positioned to defeat former president Donald Trump.Now, since Mr. Biden bowed out and Ms. Harris has stepped in, Mr. Sanders has raised questions about what the Harris campaign’s economic message will be and how she will position herself.More recently though, Mr. Sanders has been on the campaign trail for Ms. Harris.His journey is indicative of a larger question facing the progressive wing of the Democratic Party — a question we explore today.With this new Democratic ticket, are progressives all in for Harris?On today’s episode: Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont

Lena,Malia,Amber,Pete Buttigieg,H,What Pete Buttigieg Learned Playing JD Vance,"America has become increasingly polarized when it comes to trust. Voters who distrust the system — who see institutions as corrupt and are prone to conspiracy theories — have long existed on the far left and far right. But Donald Trump seems to have sparked a realignment, what the writer Matthew Yglesias calls “the crank realignment.” The G.O.P. is now the political home of the distrustful, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Trump endorsement was a clear sign of these changing times.In 2020, Pete Buttigieg wrote a book on trust in politics. And he’s been persistent in making the case — in speeches, on TV — for what he calls “a better kind of politics.” So I wanted to talk to him about his theory of politics. Why does he think so many Americans have lost trust in the government? What responsibility does the Democratic Party have here? And how does he believe trust can be restored?Note: I invited Buttigieg on the show in his personal capacity so we could discuss his thoughts on the election without violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits members of the government from campaigning in their official guise. This also means I wasn't able to ask Buttigieg many questions about his work as transportation secretary. But I think we still had a pretty fascinating conversation.",The Ezra Klein Show,,Pete Buttigieg on 2024 and the ‘Crank Realignment’ - YouTube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JDMKyTpXWc,58,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Thomas Seeger,Rosie,Connor Swenson,Kamala Harris,H,Kamala Harris,"In the latest episode of Club Shay Shay, Shannon Sharpe welcomes none other than Vice President Kamala Harris for an inspiring conversation filled with historic moments, personal reflections, and big dreams for the future. Vice President Harris opens up about her journey of groundbreaking ""firsts,"" from becoming the first woman, Black, and Asian American U.S. Vice President to being the first female Attorney General of California. She shares memorable stories, including receiving the monumental call from President Biden that changed the trajectory of her career. The two dive into the realities of her day-to-day life, intense schedule, and dedication to staying connected with communities across the country. She also reminisces about her love of music, recounting a bucket list moment when Stevie Wonder sang her happy birthday. With only days left until Election Day, she reflects on the gravity of her role, her vision for the country, and the importance of mobilizing voters. This episode showcases Vice President Harris’s resilience, humor, and commitment to making a lasting impact for future generations. Key issues and policy considerations affecting communities across the country are at the forefront of the conversation. They discuss essential topics, including workers' rights, corporate practices, and historical injustices that have disadvantaged Black communities. From Donald Trump's discriminatory landlord practices, his involvement in the Central Park Five case, and his racially charged birtherism against President Obama, they shift to contemporary issues facing marginalized communities. Vice President Harris speaks candidly about economic disparities, noting her focus on combating inflation, housing, and price gouging while supporting affordable housing and small business initiatives. She emphasizes the need for policies that protect Social Security, ensure accessible healthcare, and address health disparities affecting Black men, particularly in colon and prostate cancer screenings. With Election Day approaching, she stresses the significance of the upcoming choice, advocating for leaders dedicated to working and middle-class families over self-serving interests. Important topics like immigration reform come into focus as the conversation unfolds. Vice President Harris advocates for a secure yet humane immigration system, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach that allows individuals to earn their citizenship while effectively addressing border security. This perspective stands in stark contrast to the often divisive rhetoric seen during Trump’s presidency. As the episode progresses, VP Harris critiques current political figures and highlights the urgent need for a new generation of leaders committed to real change, calling out the failures of the past.
